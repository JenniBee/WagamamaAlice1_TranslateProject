The body of the huge lizard collapses.[p]
The rays of light perfectly penetrated through the body of the gigantic lizard. [p]

……somehow, there is some magical power left.[n]
I'll use it, whether it's frustrating or not.[p]
Ha……no way.[n]
It's impossible to misappropriate the light rays.[p]

#Mig
.......... [p]
Ocean……. [p]
#Alice
Aha! [n]
Oh, that's right. [p]
Beyond this ocean, [n]
There are countries, races and cultures not of this world, [p]
The witch of this world came from such a country. [p]
In the past, my master also said the same thing was true here. [p]
I will someday get out of here. [n]
I'd like to see the outside world. [p]
Mig ... you are getting even stronger, [n]
About me. [p]
#Mig
Master ... .... [p]
Yeah ... ... I will follow. [p]
I want to follow my master! ! [p]
#Alice
Ha ha! [n]
Well said. [p]
Here, then tie the ribbon to the stonework there. [p]
So the ceremony is over. [p]
#Mig
Ceremony ......? [n]
It's not training? [p]
#Alice
It is definitely also good practice. [p]
But this is also a ceremony to get into our school. [p]
#Mig
To the school ... .... [p]
#Alice
Indeed! [n]
It seems that your school is Wilkett. [p]
From now on, Mig, you are a member of Wilkett School. [p]
Do you understand? [p]
#Mig
Yes, yes! [p]
#Alice
Excellent! [p]
Oh, that's right. [n]
You used destructive light, didn't you? [p]
That is the magic of Liberal Democracy. [n]
You can not handle that as an apprentice. [p]
Do not use it until the time comes. [p]
#Mig
Oh, sorry .... [n]
That time is inevitable. [p]
#Alice
Hmm, I understand. [p]
Now, let's go home. [n]
Chishire is cooking rice and waiting for us. [p]
#Mig
Oh, wait master! [p]
[cn]
Alice turned away as the sea reflected the setting sun, [p]
Towards the remaining masonry.[n]
Veronica, Alice, Magee, [n]
And Mig. [p]
The ribbon of generations of witches, [n]
She was afraid of the wind that would take them all away. [p]
