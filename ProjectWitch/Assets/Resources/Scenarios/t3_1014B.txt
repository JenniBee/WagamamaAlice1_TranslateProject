#Mig
.......... [p]
Ocean……. [p]
#Alice
Aha! [n]
Oh, that's right. [p]
Beyond this ocean, [n]
There are countries, races and cultures not of this world, [p]
The witch of this world came from such a country. [p]
In the past, my master also said the same thing was true here. [p]
................ [p]
Mig, I officially welcome you to our school. [p]
#Mig
Well ... that ... what does that mean? [p]
#Alice
This exhibition was also a ceremony at the same time. [p]
So you now go to our school. [p]
Mig
To the school ... .... [p]
#Alice
Indeed! [n]
It seems that your school is Wilkett. [p]
From now on, Mig, you are a member of Wilkett School. [p]
Do you understand? [p]
#Mig
Yes, yes! [p]
#Alice
Excellent! [p]
Well, you could not defeat the last trial, but [n]
Still you showed courage, [n]
You got to the front of the hill. [p]
You faced that huge lizard without running away. [p]
That's why you passed. [p]
#Mig
Master ... .... [p]
#Alice
Yes, well... [p]
Do not hesitate on the next challenge. [n]
If you lose in practice, you will die there. [p]
Please take care. [p]
#Mig
Yes, yes!! [p]
#Alice
Now, let's go home. [n]
Chishire is cooking rice and waiting for us. [p]
Mig
Oh, wait master! [p]
[cn]
Alice turned away as the sea reflected the setting sun. [p]
For the remaining infantry: [n]
Veronica, Alice, Magee, [n]
And Mig, [p]
The ancestral tapestry of generations of witches, [n]
She was afraid of the oncoming wind that would cast them all away. [p]
